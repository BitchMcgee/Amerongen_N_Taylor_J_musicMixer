# Authoring Music Mixer Concept Description
Nicholas Amerongen  - Josh Taylor
The direction for our Music Mixer is a fantasy adventure kit assembler that combines into a simulated band when all the elements are put into place. Initially the design centered around the ‘Drop Zone’ culminating into a single character using different pieces one would have in either their inventory or character setup. This included a headpiece, race, chestpiece and weapon. In addition there are 4 classes to choose different combinations from.

When a certain item was equipped onto the character sheet, it would appear onto the character model. All the inventory items were designed to fit the same proportions for the armor and arm position for the weapon. For the race it was planned to give some slight variation to the presentation. The races for the mage, bard, ranger and warrior were decided to have designated races in the preset inventory - those being human, dwarf, elf and orc in the same order. Each item class represents a different musical portion.

Elements:
Helm - Race - Weapon - Armour Actions:
Melody - Vocal - Bass - Percussion Wizard Details:
Pointed Hat - Human - Staff - Robes Bard Details:
Horned helm - Dwarf - Lute - Travel coat Ranger Details:
Cowl - Elf - Bow - Leather Armour Warrior Details:
Skull helm - Orc - BattleAxe - Iron cuirass

Depending on which race was selected by the user the character model displayed would either be at 50%(Dwarf), 75%(Human and Elf) and 100%(Orc). The empty model will be displayed at 75% as human is often default, and it will allow for the shrinking/growth of the Dwarf and Orc to be emphasized.
Current Concept
We eventually began moving in a different direction with how the drag n drop tiles will be presented while remaining with the fantasy adventure assembler idea. Instead of a player’s inventory/screen setup the background will display the board of a GameMaster, and in the 4 placeable slots one can build a team of adventurers for a musical campaign.
